## Parts of your game

The purpose of this game is to match all 16 cards in a total of eight pairs.  
Each time two cards are opened, the number of "moves" icons increases.   
This number shows your attempt to match cards.   
If a total of 16 cards match, the game ends.   
When you press the "Restart"  icon at the top, the game returns to its initial state.
